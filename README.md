rHealthDataGov
==============

This package provides an R interface to the [HealthData.gov data API](http://www.healthdata.gov).

**Note to users:** The HealthData.gov Data API is currently down.  See this [issue](https://github.com/rOpenHealth/rHealthDataGov/issues/3) for updates.

Info
====

This package currently supports querying the 33 [Hospital Compare](http://hub.healthdata.gov/dataset/hospital-compare-api) data sets that are available via the [HealthData.gov Data API](http://www.healthdata.gov/data-api).  These data sets contain information related to process of care, mortality, and readmission quality measures of U.S. hospitals.

The full functionality of the API is exposed through this package, so you can pass one or more filters that subset a data set on the server-side, returning only the records that match your query.  The original API limits the number of records returned by a query to 100 records per HTTP request.  This package simplifies the retrieval process by making multiple HTTP requests on your behalf and returning the full result of your query as an R data frame.  We also simplify the experience by providing two data objects that provide metadata about the data sources, their available fields and field values.  These data objects, which are included in the package, include a data frame called `resources` that describes the available data sources and a list called `filters` that includes the available filters for each data resource along with the unique values that exist for each filter.

Please visit the R package documentation for more information.


Examples

Query Hospital Characteristics 
------------------------------

The query parameters are passed in POST request in JSON format.  Here is an example of a query that can be executed with this package.  This is a query of the "Hospital Characteristics" data set that filters to hospitals in San Francisco, CA using the [curl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL#cURL) command line tool.

```shell
curl http://hub.Healthdata.gov/api/action/datastore_search --data-urlencode '
{
  "resource_id": "391792b5-9c0a-48a1-918f-2ee63caa1c54",
  "filters": {
    "addr_city": "SAN FRANCISCO"
  }
}'
```

Using this package, we can make the same request as follows:

```r
> df <- fetch_healthdata(resource="hosp", filter=list(addr_city="SAN FRANCISCO"))
> dim(df)
[1] 10 14
> head(df)
      addr_city provider_id    tel_nbr seqn              addr_line_1

```

To apply multiple filters, we add list elements to the `filter` argument as follows:

```r
> myfilter <- list(addr_city="SAN FRANCISCO", ownership_type="Government - Local")
> df <- fetch_healthdata(resource="hosp", filter=myfilter)
> dim(df)
[1]  2 14
```


To retrieve the entire data set without filtering, you simply set `filter = NULL` and wait for the response.

```r
> system.time(df <- fetch_healthdata("hosp", filter=NULL))
   user  system elapsed 
  1.902   0.136  15.207 
> dim(df)
[1] 4609   14
```

Query Healthcare Quality Indicators
===================================

Here we will query for providers with a post-op respiratory failure that is "Worse than the U.S. National Rate".  This info is available in the "Healthcare Research and Quality Indicators, Providers (ahrqp)" data set.

```r
> myfilter <- list(psi_11_postop_respfail_1="Worse than U.S. National Rate")
> df <- fetch_healthdata(resource="ahrqp", filter=myfilter)
> dim(df)
[1] 251  63
```
